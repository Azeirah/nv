nv - The batteries-included nixvim distribution For Nix development, by Nix developers

nv is meant to üåüshine when dealing with a file that ends with .nix, and üõ†Ô∏èwork when dealing with a file that doesn't.

Hi friendly peoples of the Nix world.

I have a short proposal for `nv` (pronounced "envy", ha!), a nixvim distribution aimed at editing `.nix` files.

When you are new to development, it can get overwhelming very quickly. A new language, conventions you don't understand, what even are best practices here?

Or even if you are a more experienced Nix developer, there isn't a single Nix-focused editor experience.

What if we had a simple and focused pre-configured Nixvim distribution that is perfect for getting started with Nix development?

## What NV isn't

- NV is not a general-purpose Neovim distribution. Its primary purpose is to shine when dealing with a file that ends with .nix, and to work when dealing with a file that doesn't.
- NV is not a solution to the documentation problem Nix is dealing with. It's an editor.

## Features

- [ ] Contains a formatter
- [ ] Syntax highlighting for `.nix` files and flakes
- [ ] Contains the best linting the community currently has to offer

## Documentation

- [ ] Distributed as a flake

## That's it

:)

Thanks for reading
