nv - A batteries-included nixvim distribution for nix development, inspired by kickstart

---

Hi friendly peoples of the Nixvim world.

I have a short proposal for `nv` (pronounced "envy", ha!), a nixvim distribution aimed at Nix developers.

When you are new to development, it can get overwhelming very quickly. A new language, conventions you don't understand, what even are best practices here?

What if we had a simple and focused pre-configured distribution that is perfect for getting started with Nix development?

## Features

- [ ] Contains a high-quality formatter
- [ ] Syntax highlighting for nix and flakes
- [ ] Contains quality linting

## Documentation

- [ ] Distributed as a flake
- [ ] Commented like [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)

## That's it

:)

Thanks for reading
